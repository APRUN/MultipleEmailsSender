# **MultipleEmailsSender** 📧

## **Requirements:**
1. 📑 An Email Template
2. 🐍 **Pandas** Library installed for Python
3. 🗂️ A **CSV** file containing emails in the **Email** column
4. 🔐 A **Google** account

---

## **How It Works:**

### **1️⃣ Prepare Your Email List & Template:**
- Add your recipient emails in **emails.csv** 📂.
- Customize your **email template** to fit your message. ✍️

### **2️⃣ Set Up the Sender Script:**
- Open the **sender.py** file in your code editor. 💻
- Add your email address in the script. 📨
- Choose a **subject** for your emails. 📬
- For **password**, use an **App Password** (don’t use your regular Google account password for security purposes). ⚠️

### **3️⃣ What is an App Password? 🤔**
An **App Password** is a secure alternative to your Google account password. Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to your **Google Account**.
2. In Chrome or your browser, click on your **Google profile** at the top right and select **Manage your Google Account**.
3. Navigate to **Security** and enable **2-step verification** if it’s not already activated. 🔒
4. After enabling 2-step verification, search for **App Passwords** in the search bar at the top.
5. From there, you can **generate a new App Password**. You can name it anything, like **"MultipleEmailsSender"**.
6. A password will appear – **copy and paste** it into your script. 🔑

⚠️ **Important:**  
- **Never** share your **App Password** publicly (e.g., GitHub or anywhere else) for security reasons! 🛑  
- If it's necessary, use **local environment variables** to keep your password safe. 🛡️

And that's it! 🎉 Once everything is set up, you'll be ready to send personalized emails to everyone on your list in no time. 📤
